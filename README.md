# Massive Supernova Dataset
Welcome to the Massive Supernova Dataset. This dataset of 12,992 supernovae was created using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility and was classified by the photometric supernova classifier provided here. 

The supernova classifier file is too large for GitHub, so we provide a link to download:
